![3-Tier Application Deployment Diagram](./image.png)

Welcome to the **Multi-Stage Deployment Project**, an infrastructure-as-code (IaC) solution built with Terraform to automate the deployment of AWS resources across multiple environments: **Development (Dev)**, **Staging (Stage)**, and **Production (Prod)**.

## Overview

This project automates the creation and management of AWS resources across three environments:
- **Each environment contains:** 
  - S3 bucket
  - EC2 instance
  - DynamoDB table

By using Terraform, the project ensures consistency, scalability, and maintainability while enabling easy updates and rollbacks.

## Features

- **Multi-Stage Environments:** Isolated environments (Dev, Stage, Prod) to support agile development and testing.
- **AWS Resource Automation:** Fully automated setup of EC2, S3, and DynamoDB resources.
- **Terraform Best Practices:** Modular structure with variables and outputs for reusable configurations.
- **Scalability:** Easily adapt to growing infrastructure needs with minimal changes.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Separate environments for efficient resource usage and testing.
